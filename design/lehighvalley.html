    <p>In Summer 2019, Chestnut Hill College was ready to announce their partnership with DeSales University dubbed “CHC @ LHV.”
      The idea is that DeSales will host Clinical and Counseling Psychology courses offered by CHC at their main campus, extending the
      latter’s reach further into the Lehigh Valley in Pennsylvania. A marketing campaign was in the works and I was responsible for
      designing the digital advertisements to be sent to the online Allentown periodical The Morning Call and, importantly, the landing page.
      Both took less than a month to complete.</p>
    <h2>My Process</h2>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>I Googled for colleges offering similar satellite campus and dual enrollment programs to get an idea of how their landing pages were structured.
      Some common threads included a blurb on the top, a Google widget pinpointing the location, and a form for requesting info.</p>

      </picture>
      <h3>Ideation</h3>
      <p>Since I was working on the ads simultaneously with the landing page, I knew our call to action was “enroll now” so I made sure the
        landing page offered enough information about the program for visitors to turn into prospective students. The first iterations with pull
        quotes were influenced by similar pages I’ve seen on the Chestnut Hill College site. These were scrapped to condense the page to it’s most important parts.</p>

      <h3>Wireframe</h3>
      <p>Based on the layout on Chestnut Hill College’s website, I designed the landing page similarly to that of a graduate admissions page to reinforce brand consistency.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>The landing page has been edited since in order to flow with the rest of the site’s navigation more smoothly and to avoid duplicates in the website’s online content.
        New ads are being utilized in recirculated print advertisements in the Lehigh Valley. My department and I received glowing feedback from the lead professor in the program, excited about the program’s growing online presence.</p>
